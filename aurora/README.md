## Overview

aurora is a web-based Beanstalkd queue server console written in Go and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows machines. The main idea behind using Go for backend development is to utilize the ability of the compiler to produce zero-dependency binaries for multiple platforms. aurora was created as an attempt to build a very simple and portable application to work with a local or remote Beanstalkd server.
